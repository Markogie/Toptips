      Loader loaded all as % discounts with 50 & 91 priorities. But, missed to realize that the 50% discount that is supposed to apply on Gala supplement only is also being applied on normal board supplements.",

      "Restrictions being loaded as % discount will instruct the system to deduct the same % on: all rates/supplements loaded adjacent to its adjustments (whether apply to room or board AND loaded under adult, child or room adjustments); and all criteria with priority that is lower than the % discount restriction. <br/>
      - Loading the exact amount of reduction is the other workaround if loading 2 different % discounts at the same time is not possible. <br/>
- Test Availability is also part of the loading process. Testing guidelines presented in Loading-Approving Checklist must be strictly followed.",
